# Alternative components for Rivendell templates

Each folder has all files needed to apply to the Rivendel template for the design, along with a folder of screenshots. You can navigate these files directly but the best way is to use the builder UI:

## [Open Rivendell Builder](https://design.reallyeasycart.co.uk/rivendell-components/)

## Contributing

New designs are welcome :)
Make a pull request with a new folder in either headers or footers (or a new one) for your new design. 

Please add screenshots & all files required in the paths as they would be used, then also update the docs/builder.js to show off your new design. Thank you.
